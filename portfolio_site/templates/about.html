            I'm Benjamin Eklund, a soon-to-be graduate from Sacramento State with a degree in Computer Science. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in software engineering, focusing on game development, system architectures, and backend services.

            In my current role at Inductive Automation, I have gained valuable experience working with the Ignition platform, troubleshooting complex systems, and delivering technical solutions for SCADA environments.
