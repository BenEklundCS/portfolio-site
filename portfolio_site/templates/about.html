        <p>
            Hi, I’m Ben Eklund, and I’m about to graduate from Sacramento State with a degree in Computer Science. Over the years, I’ve developed a deep passion for software engineering, where I get to combine my love for building things from scratch with solving complex problems. What excites me most is transforming ideas—whether it’s a new feature for a game I’m developing or an automation script—into reality through well-crafted code.
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently, I work at Inductive Automation as a Software Support Engineer, specializing in troubleshooting and optimizing SCADA systems with the Ignition platform. This role has sharpened my problem-solving abilities and exposed me to the high-pressure world of real-time industrial systems. It’s taught me that no matter how challenging the problem, there’s always a resolution to be found.
        </p>

        <p>
            As I move forward, I’m excited to step into a full-time software engineering role where I can dive even deeper into system architecture and optimization, and work on projects at a larger scale. When I’m not working, I’m often tinkering with personal projects—usually game development or web apps—where I combine what I’ve learned in school with hands-on experience to create something meaningful.
        </p>
