        <p>
            Hi, I’m Ben Eklund, a soon-to-be graduate from Sacramento State with a degree in Computer Science. Over the years, I’ve discovered a true passion for software engineering, where I get to combine my love for building things from scratch with solving complex problems. What excites me most is taking an idea, whether it’s a game mechanic or a large-scale system, and seeing it come to life through well-crafted code.
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently, I’m working at Inductive Automation as a Software Support Engineer, where I specialize in troubleshooting and optimizing SCADA systems using the Ignition platform. My time in this role has not only sharpened my problem-solving skills but also exposed me to the high-pressure environments of real-time industrial systems. It’s helped me realize that no matter how challenging the problem, there's always a solution that can be designed and executed with efficiency.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m looking forward to transitioning into a dedicated software engineering role, where I can dive deeper into system architecture, optimization, and development at scale. In my free time, I explore personal projects, focusing on game development, backend services, and systems programming—fields where I can bring together my academic knowledge and industry experience to create impactful software.
        </p>
