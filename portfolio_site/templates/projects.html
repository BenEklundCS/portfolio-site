        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout my projects, I have built expertise in game development, real-time systems, and full-stack web development. Each project showcases a combination of problem-solving abilities, creativity, and technical skills:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Game Development:</strong> I’ve developed complex game logic using languages such as C++ and Java, focusing on optimizing performance and enhancing player interactions with event-driven programming techniques and design patterns like Observer and Command.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Systems:</strong> I’ve worked on optimizing game loops, real-time rendering, and performance efficiency, such as improving Conway’s Game of Life for high computational efficiency with large grids.</li>
            <li><strong>Full-Stack Development:</strong> My portfolio site demonstrates my proficiency in creating scalable, responsive web applications using Django, CSS, and HTML, with a focus on clean, reusable code and modern design principles.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Moving forward, I am excited to expand my skills through the upcoming Health Geo project, where I will gain further hands-on experience with geospatial tools, data visualization, and full-stack development, positioning myself for software engineering roles in both private and public sectors.
