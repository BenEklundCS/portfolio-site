        <h3>Geo | Full Stack Spatial Data Platform for HCAI | (Senior Project)</h3>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
        <p>
            <em>Geo</em> is a full-stack web application developed for our senior project, in collaboration with stakeholders focused on public data transparency. It allows users to visualize and interact with geospatial data from across California. The system integrates multiple datasets, enabling geocoding, reverse geocoding, and spatial enrichment, all served through a performant and scalable backend.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Built geocoding and reverse geocoding APIs using Azure Maps and custom spatial logic.</li>
            <li>Processed and imported spatial data from CSVs and shapefiles into PostGIS-enabled PostgreSQL databases.</li>
            <li>Developed robust RESTful APIs in Django to support real-time query and data exploration.</li>
            <li>Deployed performant caching with Redis to improve response times for repeated queries.</li>
            <li>Collaborated on a team using Agile practices to deliver milestones and integrate data pipelines.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Skills and Technologies:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Languages/Tools:</strong> Python, Django, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Azure Maps, Redis, Git, Docker</li>

        <p>
            <em>The Land of Boars</em> is a work in progress 2D platformer game built in C++ using the Raylib library. This project involves implementing various game mechanics, including player movement, collision detection, animation handling, and sound management, all organized through Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed complex game logic for player actions and interactions with the enviornment.</li>
            <li>Implemented a custom renderer for background and game object rendering.</li>
            <li>Integrated a sound manager for handling in-game sounds, and a texture manager both using the <strong>Singleton pattern</strong>.</li>
            <li>Used design patterns like the <strong>Observer pattern</strong> for event handling and <strong>Command pattern</strong> for input management.</li>
            <li>Focused on performance optimization, including parallelizing update loops for improved gameplay experience.</li>
            <li>Built in debug and developer menus using the popular ImGui library.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Skills and Technologies:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Languages/Tools:</strong> C++, Raylib, CLion, ImGui</li>
            <li><strong>Key Concepts:</strong> OOP, game physics, event-driven programming, performance optimization</li>
