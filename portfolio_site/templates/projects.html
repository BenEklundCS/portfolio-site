        <h3>Slconwaysgol (Conwayâ€™s Game of Life in Java with LWJGL)</h3>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
        <p>
            <em>Slconwaysgol</em> is a personal interpretation of Conway's Game of Life, implemented in Java using the <strong>Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL)</strong>. While originally a class project, it was extended and optimized for enhanced performance and graphical display.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Designed a flexible simulation engine that handles Conway's rules efficiently, even with large grids.</li>
            <li>Used <strong>LWJGL</strong> for rendering the grid and updating the simulation in real-time.</li>
            <li>Implemented user interactions to modify grid states, allowing for dynamic game environments.</li>
            <li>Focused on optimizing grid updates to ensure minimal computational load during complex transitions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Skills and Technologies:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Languages/Tools:</strong> Java, LWJGL</li>
            <li><strong>Key Concepts:</strong> Cellular automata, real-time rendering, user interaction, game loop optimization</li>

    <!-- Health Geo Project -->
    <section>
        <h3>Health Geo Project for State of California (Senior Project)</h3>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
        <p>
            This project is part of a broader effort to map and analyze health data across various geographic locations in California. The goal is to develop a system that helps visualize public health trends and provide insights that could inform state policies.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key Features (Planned):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Design and implement a web-based system for displaying health data trends using geographic mapping.</li>
            <li>Work with government-provided health data to create meaningful visualizations, highlighting trends and disparities across regions.</li>
            <li>Collaborate with a team of students to manage the project lifecycle, from requirements gathering to deployment.</li>
            <li>Ensure data integrity and privacy while handling sensitive health information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Skills and Technologies (Planned):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Languages/Tools:</strong> Python (or JavaScript), Django, SQL, Map APIs</li>
            <li><strong>Key Concepts:</strong> Data visualization, geospatial analysis, full-stack development, team collaboration</li>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Each project is crafted to emphasize my skills in 
            game development, 
            real-time systems, and 
            full-stack development. 
            As I complete the Health Geo project, I will gain further hands-on experience with geospatial 
            tools and backend systems, preparing me for software engineering roles in both private and public sectors.
